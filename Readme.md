# Buttons handling library for Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico 2
## Overview
This project is a library for handling multiple buttons on Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico 2

This project features to detect:
* Single Push event
* Repeated Single Push event
* Multiple Push event (exclusive with Repeated Single)
* Long (Long) Push event (exclusive with Repeated Single)
* Switch On/Off events

## Notes
* If Multiple detection enabled, time lag defined by 'actFinishCnt' is needed to determine action
* Repeat count information of Repeated Single detection is served for UI items to accelerate something by continuous button push
* Use NewButtonConfig() for customizing button detection parameters other than default configurations

## Supported Board and Device
* Raspberry Pi Pico
* Raspberry Pi Pico 2

## How to build
* See ["Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico"](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
* Put "pico-sdk", "pico-examples" and "pico-extras" on the same level with this project folder.
* Set environmental variables for PICO_SDK_PATH, PICO_EXTRAS_PATH and PICO_EXAMPLES_PATH
* Confirmed with Pico SDK 2.1.1
```
> git clone -b 2.1.1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
> cd pico-sdk
> git submodule update -i
> cd ..
> git clone -b sdk-2.1.1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git
>
> git clone -b sdk-2.1.1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras.git
>
> git clone -b main https://github.com/elehobica/pico_buttons.git
```
